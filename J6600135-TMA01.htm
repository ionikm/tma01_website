      <h4>HOW TO REPRESENT SOUND IN DIGITAL FORM</h4>
          <p>We can represent an analogue sound in digital form using a series of graphs. First, we need the sound in wave form to set a <strong style="color: #cc6600;"><i>sampling rate</i></strong> which is the times per second a sample is used.
          <br /><br />

<br>
          Let us say the sampling rate is 0.2 then every 0.2 seconds we draw a line horizontally on our sound wave graph, and were it meets with the sound wave we take coordinates. After we have all coordinates, we draw a new graphic based on the values that we get. If the sampling rate is too big then the digital version of the sound will be low quality therefore, we should use a smaller sampling rate. 
          
          <br /><br />
          
          The second step of transforming an analogue sound to digital form is the <strong style="color: #cc6600;"><i>quantisation stage</i></strong> which divides the maximum voltage into smaller voltage bands represented by numbers.</p>
